# Obituaries

A mod for Factorio 0.14.13 and above.

> When you die, the mod guesstimates what caused your death and messages other players so they know of your failure.

Features over 100 short obituaries, categorised by cause of death:

* Friendly attack
* Enemy attack
* Drowning (player ends up on water tile)
* Fire
* Biters, etc
* Trains
* Fish!
* Unknown

More can be added over time, a list of possible things can be found [here](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=32741). Just [ask](https://github.com/aubergine10/obituaries/issues) :)

By default it will limit to one obituary per 2 minutes (edit `delay` value in `control.lua` to change that). This is to prevent obituary spam in large MP games.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome, via [github](https://github.com/aubergine10/obituaries) please!

I've tried to structure it so it's as simple as possible to add new causes of death (entity types in particular), the obituaries themselves, and also localisation.
